# Namespaced Merkle Tree

## Abstract

Namespaced Merkle Tree (NMT) is one of the core components of the Celestia blockchain.
Transactions in Celestia are associated with a namespace ID which signifies the application they belong to.
Nodes interested in a specific application only need to download transactions of a certain namespace ID.
The Namespaced  Merkle Tree (NMT) was introduced in the [LazyLedger article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09274) to organize transactions in Celestia blocks based on their namespace IDs.
The NMT allows for efficient and verifiable queries of application-specific transactions by accessing based on the block header which contains the NMT root.
This specification explains the NMT data structure and provides an overview of its current implementation in this repository.
The NMT library, which is the implementaion of NMT data structure, is explained in the [NMT Library](./../nmt-lib.md) document.

## NMT Data Structure

Namespaced Merkle Tree, at its core, is a normal Merkle tree that employs a modified hash function, namely a [namespaced hash](#namespaced-hash) to ensure each node in the tree encompasses the range of namespaces of its descendants' messages.
Messages stored in the NMT leaves are all namespace-prefixed with the format `<NsID>||<Message Data>` and arranged in ascending order based on their namespace IDs.
All namespace identifiers have a fixed and known size.

### Namespaced Hash

NMT utilizes a namespaced hash function i.e., `NsH()`, which in addition to the normal digest calculation, it returns the range of namespace IDs covered by a node's children. The hash output is formatted as  `minNs||maxNs||h(.)`, where `minNs` is the lowest namespace identifier among all the node's descendants, `maxNs` is the highest, and `h(.)` represents the hash digest of `.` (e.g., `SHA256(.)`).

**Leaf Nodes**: Each leaf in the tree represents the namespaced hash of a namespaced message `d = <NsID>||<Message Data>`.
The hash is computed as follows:

```go
NsH(d) = d.NsID || d.NsID || h(0x00, d)
```

The inclusion of the `0x00` value in the hash calculation serves as a leaf prefix and is done to conform to [RFC 6962](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6962#section-2.1).

**Non-leaf Nodes**: For an intermediary node `n` of the NMT with children

`l` = `l.minNs || l.maxNs || l.hash` and

`r` = `r.minNs || r.maxNs || r.hash`

the namespaced hash is calculated as

```go
NsH(n) = min(l.minNs, r.minNs) || max(l.maxNs, r.maxNs) || h(0x01, l, r)
```

The inclusion of the `0x01` value in the hash calculation serves as a non-leaf prefix and is done to conform to [RFC 6962](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6962#section-2.1).

In an NMT data structure, the `minNs` and `maxNs` values of the root node denote the minimum and maximum namespace IDs, respectively, of all messages within the tree.

An example of an NMT is shown in the figure below which utilizes SHA256 as the underlying hash function and namespace ID size of `1` byte.
The code snippets necessary to create this tree are provided in [NMT Library](./../nmt-lib.md) documentation, and the data items and tree nodes are represented as hex strings.
For the sake of brevity, we have only included the first 7 hex digits of SHA256 for each namespace hash.

### Namespace Proof

NMT supports standard Merkle tree functionalities, including inclusion and range proofs, and offers namespace ID querying and proof generation.
The following enumerated cases explain potential outcomes when querying an NMT for a namespace ID.

#### Namespace Inclusion Proof

When the queried namespace ID `nID` has corresponding items in the tree with root `T`, the query is resolved by a
namespace inclusion proof which consists of:

1) The starting index `start` and the ending index `end` of the leaves that match `nID`.
2) Nodes of the tree that are necessary for the regular Merkle range proof of `[start, end)` to `T`.
   In specific, the nodes include 1) the [namespaced hash](#namespaced-hash) of the left siblings for the Merkle
   inclusion proof of the `start` leaf and 2) the [namespaced hash](#namespaced-hash) of the right siblings of the Merkle inclusion proof of  the `end` leaf.
   Nodes are sorted according to the in-order traversal of the tree.

For example, the NMT proof of `nID = 0` in Figure 1 would be `[start = 0, end = 2)` and the Merkle inclusion proof embodies one single tree node i.e., `01 03 52c7c03`.

#### Namespace Absence Proof

If the namespace ID being queried falls within the range of namespace IDs in the tree root, but there is no corresponding message, an absence proof will be generated.
An absence proof asserts that no message in the tree matches the queried namespace ID `nID`.

The absence proof consists of:

1) The index of a leaf of the tree that
   1) its namespace ID is the smallest namespace ID larger than `nID` and
   2) the namespace ID of the leaf to the left of it is smaller than `nID`.
2) A regular Merkle inclusion proof for the said leaf to the tree root `T`.

Note that the proof only requires the hash of the leaf, not its underlying message.
This is because the aim of the proof is to demonstrate the absence of `nID`.

In Figure 1, if we query for `nID = 2`, we will receive an absence proof since there is no matching item for it.
The index of the leaf included in the proof will be `3`, which corresponds to the node `03 03 b4a2792`.
The Merkle inclusion proof for this leaf consists of the following nodes, in the order they appear in an in-order traversal of the tree: `00 00 ead8d25` and `01 01 71ca46a`.

#### Namespace Empty Proof

If the requested namespace ID falls outside the namespace range represented by the tree root `T`, the query will be resolved with an empty namespace proof.
In Figure 1, a query for `nID=6` would be responded by an empty proof as it falls outside the root's namsespace range.

### Namespace Proof verification

#### Verification of NMT Inclusion Proof

An NMT inclusion proof is deemed valid if it meets the following:

- The namespace ID of the leaves in the returned range `[start, end)` match the queried `nID`.
- **Inclusion**: The supplied Merkle proof for the range `[start, end)` is valid for the given tree root `T`.
- **Completeness**: There are no other leaves matching `nID` that do not belong to the returned range `[start, end)`.

Proof _inclusion_ can be verified via a regular Merkle range proof verification.
However, _completeness_ of the proof requires additional checks.
Specifically, 1) the maximum namespace ID of the nodes in the proof that are on the left side of the branch connecting the `start` leaf to the root must be less than the provided namespace ID (`nID`), and 2) the minimum namespace ID of the nodes in the proof that are on the right side of the branch connecting the
 `end-1` leaf to the root must be greater than the provided namespace ID (`nID`).

As an example, the namespace proof for `nID = 0` for the NMT of Figure 1 (which consists of one single node i.e., `01 03 52c7c03`) is complete. This is because the node `01 03 52c7c03` is located on the right side of the branch connecting the leaf at index `end = 1` to the root and its `minNs` value is `01`, which is greater than `nID = 0`.

#### Verification of NMT Absence Proof

An NMT absence proof is deemed valid if it meets the following:

1) The minimum namespace ID of the leaf in the proof is greater than the queried `nID`.
2) The verification of Merkle inclusion proof of the returned leaf is valid.
3) It satisfies the proof completeness as explained in the [Verification of NMT Inclusion Proof](#verification-of-nmt-inclusion-proof).
Note that hash of the leaf does not have to be verified against the underlying message.

#### Verification of Empty NMT proof

If the queried `nID` falls outside the namespace range of the tree root, or the namespace tree is empty, then an empty NMT proof is valid by definition.
